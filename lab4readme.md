>I'm working on a system that helps hospitals manage their tasks better. This includes keeping track of patient info, scheduling appointments, and handling money matters. The goal is to make things smoother and improve how patients are taken care of.

>Starting with the primary entity "Patient" for Lab 4, we can identify other critical entities in the hospital management system, including "Doctor," "Appointment," and "Receipt." The relationship between "Patient" and "Doctor" is essential, representing the interaction during medical appointments. The "Appointment" entity acts as a connector, associating both "Patient" and "Doctor." Furthermore, the inclusion of the "Receipt" entity introduces the financial dimension, linking to both "Patient" and "Appointment." This setup signifies that receipts are generated for appointments involving patients.
